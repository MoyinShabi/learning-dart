/* "Factory Constructors" are useful in two kinds of scenarios:
1. When we need to implement a constructor that doesn't always create a new instance of its class.
That is, regular constructors must return an instance of the class itself, but "Factory constructors" can return an instance of a subclass.

2. When we need to initialize a final variable using logic that can't be handled in the initializer list.

/* NOTE:
  Regular constructors: all final variables must be initialized immediately (as arguments or with the initializer list).

  Factory constructors: can execute any arbitrary logic first, and then return an instance of a subclass or the class itself. 
 */

A good use case for this is when we are parsing some data that comes from the network, and this is typically stored in JSON format. This is a common task that many applications need to do. 
*/

// In Dart, we can represent JSON data using a map of key-value pairs.

/* An Example:
 Consider the `Shape`, `Square` and `Circle` classes that we have implemented a little while ago. And to make things interesting, suppose that we are building a program, that we can use to show different shapes on screen. These shapes can be stored inside a database on the server, and our client application can request a list of shapes to be drawn on screen. When the server receives this request, it sends back a response containing JSON data, which may look like this. And when the client receives this data, it needs to process it and map each item into a Shape instance. And this can be done with a factory constructor.

  It's possible, and easy to replace the factory constructor with a `static` method that returns an object of type `Shape`. The code will work just fine, however, by convention, when you want to initialize a class instance such as in this case, then it's recommended to use a `factory` constructor.

  }
  // NOTE: `Object` is a good choice for the type of the `values` of the `json` `Map` argument, because it is the superclass of all classes in Dart. So, prefer `Object` to `dynamic` when working with maps, because the type system will help more as we do so.

  /* NOTE:
     JSON best practices:
     - Check all edge cases (e.g, the conditional logic above to switch on the type of the shape).
     - Throw an error if the input data is invalid (e.g, the defensive logic above using the `throw` keyword, which ensures that all the values we get are of the correct type).
    
    When reading JSON data that comes from a server, it's a good idea to add all this extra logic, because it makes our code safer to use. 
  */

/* NOTE:
   How constructors are generated:

   - If a class doesn't have any constructors, Dart will generate an "implicit" one with no arguments(and because of this, subclasses' constructors don't need to call `super()`).

   - If a class has one or more constructors, the implicit one with no arguments won't be generated (and subclasses' constructors don't have a super constructor that they can use).

   In the case above, we have added a factory constructor, and so the implicit constructor is no longer generated. So, the solution is to "explicitly" define a default constructor for the `Shape` class, which is `Shape();`, as shown above.
